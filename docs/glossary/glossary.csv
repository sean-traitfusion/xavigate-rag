Term Type,term_type,A classification that describes the kind of concept a glossary item represents.,concept,,,
Trait,trait,A behavioral pattern or tendency that expresses over time.,concept,,,
Subtrait,subtrait,A finer-grained element within a broader trait.,concept,,trait,
Trait Expression,trait_expression,"The degree to which a trait is activated and observable in a person’s real-world behavior. Trait expression may vary by context, energy level, field of engagement, or interplay with other traits. Expression is not static — it fluctuates based on alignment, environment, and trait prioritization. In many cases, the high expression of one trait can suppress or distort another, leading to asymmetrical activation across a person’s profile. Understanding trait expression is essential for distinguishing potential from actualized behavior.",concept,,"trait,subtrait,facet,trait_interplay,alignment_dynamics","“Sam has high Creative Nature, but it only shows up when he’s working alone. In group settings, he defers to others — his creative trait expression is highly context-dependent.”"
Trait Suppression,trait_suppression,"A condition in which a trait is present but not actively expressed due to internal conflict, external constraints, or overpowering influence from another trait. Suppression may be temporary or chronic and can arise from misalignment, social conditioning, field mismatch, or trait interplay. Suppressed traits often leak out in distorted ways or remain dormant until triggered by a more aligned context. Recognizing suppression is essential for distinguishing between trait potential and trait activation.",concept,,"trait_expression,trait_interplay,alignment_dynamics,misalignment","Even though Ava has strong interpersonal skills, she stays silent during team meetings due to fear of judgment. Her Interpersonal Intelligence is present but suppressed."
Facet,facet,"A specific expression, variation, or angle of a broader trait. Facets provide nuance by showing how a trait manifests in different contexts, roles, or energies. They help distinguish between the raw presence of a trait and its situational flavor, function, or tone.",concept,,"trait,alignment_dynamics,multiple_natures_theory,trait theory",
Alignment,alignment,"A state of coherence between a person’s inner traits and their external context—such as roles, environments, or activities—where energy flows naturally and actions feel meaningful, sustainable, and authentic.",concept,,"multiple_natures_theory,multiple_natures_framework",
Alignment Index,alignment_index,"A diagnostic indicator that reflects how well an individual’s traits are aligned with their current environment, roles, or tasks. The index is based on behavioral patterns, energy flow, and observed alignment signals over time.",metric,,alignment,"After shifting into a new role where he gets to teach and design curriculum, Leo’s Alignment Index jumped. He now feels energized, focused, and creatively fulfilled."

It provides a quantifiable score that reflects one's current state of alignment.",metric,,alignment,"Over the past year, as Priya developed a clearer sense of her values and began making decisions that honored her traits, her Alignment Quotient gradually increased."
Alignment Stability,alignment_stability,"A measure of how consistently a person remains in alignment over time, especially across changing circumstances or roles. High stability suggests resilience and sustained coherence between traits and external demands.",metric,swastha,alignment,"Even though Ray changed roles and faced major life stress, he remained grounded, expressive, and energized — a sign that his alignment wasn’t just momentary but stable"
Swastha,swastha,"A culturally rooted term denoting a state of sustained alignment where traits and purpose remain harmonized over time. It reflects alignment stability—a resilient, ongoing condition in which a person’s natural tendencies and life roles are in enduring coherence, supporting well-being and effectiveness.",concept,alignment_stability,"alignment_stability,alignment,multiple_natures_theory","Even during a tough financial period, Tanya stayed grounded, purposeful, and emotionally clear. Her actions flowed from a deep place — she was living in Swastha."
Hungry Tiger,hungry_tiger,"A trait (Tiger) that is underexpressed, unacknowledged, or suppressed. A Hungry Tiger signals a need for engagement, often showing up as restlessness, dissatisfaction, or yearning for a role or activity that allows its expression.",metaphor,,misalignment,"Jon always lights up when he’s asked for advice, but his current job gives him no space to mentor others. His Educative Nature is a hungry tiger waiting to be fed."
Overfed Tiger,overfed_tiger,"A trait that is overused or given disproportionate attention, often leading to burnout, fatigue, or imbalance. Overfeeding a Tiger may indicate a lack of variety in role expression or an unhealthy dependence on one mode of functioning.",metaphor,,misalignment,"Ava’s Providing Nature is strong, but lately she’s been saying yes to everyone and feeling drained. That tiger is overfed — and it’s costing her energy."

His Administrative and Educative Tigers are both satisfied — they’re engaged but not overworked."
Modes of Engagement,modes_of_engagement,"A core concept in Alignment Dynamics describing the distinct energetic modes through which a person interacts with reality. These modes—Presence, Discovery, Realization, Connection, and Mastery—shape how traits emerge, how meaning is formed, and how alignment unfolds over time.",concept,,alignment_dynamics,
Presence,presence_mode,"A mode of engagement marked by grounded awareness and stillness — the ability to fully be with what is, without projection, resistance, or interference. Presence creates the inner condition for all other modes to arise. It is not passive or empty; it is a state of energetic receptivity, coherence, and readiness. In Presence, one becomes attuned to the subtle textures of a moment or field.",concept,,"modes_of_engagement,alignment_dynamics,trait_alignment","During her client session, Maya paused before responding, tuning into her breath and body. That moment of grounded attention was Presence in action."
Discovery,discovery_mode,"A mode of curious exploration, where energy moves outward to engage with the unknown. Discovery opens space for sensing, questioning, and playful inquiry without needing to reach immediate conclusions. It is the mode of hypothesis, possibility, and experimentation — the dance with “what might be.” Discovery generates movement toward new experiences and data that can later be shaped or integrated.",concept,,"modes_of_engagement,alignment_dynamics,emotional_instability,situational_alignment","When Leo stumbled onto a new framework in a podcast and immediately opened a notebook to explore it, he entered Discovery — following the energy of not-yet-knowing."
Realization,realization_mode,"A mode of engagement in which something comes into form or existence — where an internal potential, vision, or sensed possibility is translated into concrete action, expression, or structure. Realization is not just insight, but manifestation. It’s the shift from idea to execution, from invisible to visible. This mode carries the energy of crystallization — making something real in the world.",concept,,"modes_of_engagement,anxiety,alignment_dynamics,trait_expression","After weeks of dreaming about his vision, Niko recognized it was time to stop circling in possibility. He entered into Realization Mode â€” and began turning his ideas into a prototype."
Connection,connection_mode,"A mode of engagement characterized by the capacity to link, synthesize, and harmonize across people, ideas, systems, and opportunities. Connection involves sensing resonance across dimensions — Physical (environmental flow), Social (relationships), and Possibility (ideas, visions). It enables the creation of coherence, shared meaning, and integrated action. It is less about emotional closeness and more about relational intelligence — the ability to notice and support what wants to come together.",concept,,"modes_of_engagement,alignment_dynamics,trait_interplay","When Sara facilitated a team conversation where people felt seen, energized, and emotionally in sync, she was in the Connection mode — creating field coherence."
Mastery,mastery_mode,"A mode of integration, refinement, and sustained embodiment. Mastery is not perfection — it is the deepening of natural expression through conscious engagement. It involves repetition, feedback, and alignment over time, resulting in stability and fluency. In this mode, traits become woven into identity, and actions reflect skill, nuance, and presence.",concept,,"modes_of_engagement,swastha,sustained_flow","Lena didn’t just perform the task — she did it with grace, depth, and subtlety. Her years of integration were showing: this was Mastery at play."
Fields of Engagement,fields_of_engagement,"A core concept in Alignment Dynamics describing the distinct domains of context in which a person’s traits are expressed, distorted, or suppressed. The three Fields—Physical, Social, and Possibility—each present unique conditions, constraints, and opportunities for alignment. Understanding the Field one is currently situated in allows for more skillful engagement, appropriate trait expression, and context-sensitive decision-making.",concept,,alignment_dynamics,
Physical Field,physical_field,"The domain of tangible experience, action, and embodiment. This field includes the physical body, tools, space, objects, and task environments. It shapes how traits emerge through physical presence, movement, touch, and material interaction. Alignment in the Physical Field depends on environmental clarity, bodily regulation, rhythm, and the availability of physical resources. Misalignment here often manifests as restlessness, fatigue, clumsiness, or mechanical over-effort.",concept,,"alignment_dynamics,fields_of_engagement","After two hours of Zoom calls, Ella tidied her room and reorganized her workspace. She needed to re-enter the Physical Field to regulate her energy and feel grounded."
Social Field,social_field,"The relational domain where traits are influenced by communication, social roles, emotional atmosphere, and interpersonal energy. This field is shaped by group norms, unspoken expectations, power dynamics, and the degree of psychological safety. Alignment in the Social Field depends on one’s ability to sense others, manage relational complexity, and stay authentic while being influenced by feedback or social pressure. Misalignment here may appear as withdrawal, masking, conflict, or people-pleasing.",concept,,"alignment_dynamics,fields_of_engagement","When Josh walked into the boardroom, he could instantly feel the tension — even before anyone spoke. The Social Field was charged with hierarchy and unspoken expectations."
Possibility Field,possibility_field,"The domain of abstract thought, imagination, intuition, and future-facing potential. This field holds the realm of vision, uncertainty, and meaning-making—where new ideas form, unseen patterns are sensed, and non-linear insight becomes available. Alignment in the Possibility Field depends on spaciousness, internal stillness, and openness to ambiguity. When misaligned, this field can lead to overthinking, mental dissociation, or existential confusion. It is the most subtle and fluid of the three Fields.",concept,,"alignment_dynamics,fields_of_engagement","While walking through the forest, Kiara felt new ideas swirling into view. She had no agenda — just openness. She was in the Field of Possibilities."
Active Engagement,active_engagement,"A state of consciousness and behavioral orientation in which a person is fully present, intentional, and responsive to their environment or task. Active Engagement involves choosing to participate with awareness, rather than reacting out of habit or passivity. It is characterized by a sense of internal activation and contextual attunement—regardless of external outcome or productivity.",concept,,"modes_of_engagement,alignment_dynamics,fields_of_engagement",
Cognitive Filter,cognitive_filter,"A mental lens through which a person interprets reality, shaped by past experiences, beliefs, emotional states, and energetic conditions. Cognitive Filters influence what a person notices, prioritizes, or ignores—often determining how traits are expressed, suppressed, or distorted in the moment. They are dynamic, often subconscious, and play a key role in alignment by either clarifying or obscuring one’s perception of context, needs, or possibility.",concept,,"alignment_dynamics,situational_factors,misalignment",
Presence (Underactive),presence_mode_underactive,"A state of disconnection from the present moment. The person is mentally elsewhere — caught in thought loops, worry, or emotional detachment.

Discovery (Underactive),discovery_mode_underactive,"A state of cognitive or experiential closure. The person resists novelty, inquiry, or experimentation. Curiosity feels dormant. They may default to habitual thinking or avoid engaging with unfamiliar perspectives — often due to fear, fatigue, or fixed identity patterns.",mode_state,,"discovery_mode,misalignment,trait_suppression",
Discovery (Overactive),discovery_mode_overactive,"A restless state of chronic seeking. The person engages in endless exploration, questioning, or input consumption without integration. May show up as indecision, information overload, or inability to settle — caught in a loop of “not enough data to act.”",mode_state,,"discovery_mode,misalignment",
Realization (Underactive),realization_mode_underactive,"A blocked or murky state where insight or meaningful emergence feels unavailable. The person may feel stuck, confused, or emotionally flat.

Realization (Overactive),realization_mode_overactive,"A compulsive mode of over-meaning-making. The person assigns significance to everything, often over-interpreting experiences. May spiral into over-analysis, spiritual inflation, or excessive self-referencing — unable to rest in “just enough” realization.",mode_state,,"realization_mode,misalignment",
Connection (Underactive),connection_mode_underactive,"A fragmented or isolated state. The person feels cut off — not just from people, but from ideas, environments, and opportunities. They may feel “outside the flow,” unsupported, or invisible. This may appear as apathy, siloed thinking, or emotional withdrawal.",mode_state,,"connection_mode,misalignment",
Connection (Overactive),connection_mode_overactive,"A state of over-connection or energetic entanglement. The person becomes overly bonded to people, ideas, or systems — losing boundaries or discernment. This can result in overwhelm, distraction, or trying to hold everything together at once, often to the point of collapse.",mode_state,,connection_mode,
Mastery (Underactive),mastery_mode_underactive,"A mode of avoidance or disengagement from depth. The person resists refinement, repetition, or responsibility. Growth is abandoned prematurely, and skills remain underdeveloped. May manifest as flakiness, impostor syndrome, or fear of fully owning one’s power.",mode_state,,"mastery_mode,misalignment,trait_suppression",
Mastery (Overactive),mastery_mode_overactive,"A state of compulsive improvement or control. The person seeks perfection, overworks, or becomes rigid in pursuit of mastery.

"Multiple Intelligences Theory (Gardner)

",multiple_intelligences_theory_gardner,"A cognitive theory developed by Howard Gardner in 1983, proposing that human intelligence is not a single measurable ability (like IQ), but a set of distinct modalities through which individuals process information, solve problems, and create value. These intelligences—such as Linguistic, Logical-Mathematical, Musical, Spatial, Bodily-Kinesthetic, Interpersonal, Intrapersonal, Naturalistic, and later Existential—reflect different ways of perceiving and engaging with the world.

This framework helps individuals understand their energy patterns and align with roles, environments, and decisions that support their true nature.",concept,,"multiple_intelligences_theory_rudolph,multiple_natures_natures,trait theory",
Michael Jordan Effect,michael_jordan_effect,"A concept used to illustrate that even someone with exceptional natural ability—like Michael Jordan—may underperform if placed in the wrong context. It highlights that success isn’t just about traits or intelligence, but about being in the right role, environment, and moment where those traits can fully express. In the MN/AD system, this effect emphasizes the importance of contextual alignment—ensuring that a person’s natural abilities and tendencies are matched with the right opportunities to create real impact.",concept,,"multiple_intelligences_theory_rudolph,multiple_natures_framework,multiple_natures_natures,multiple_natures_theory",

Menu of Life,menu_of_life,"The Menu of Life is a decision-making and self-alignment tool that helps individuals explore and organize life possibilities based on their natural traits — typically their Multiple Natures (MN) and Multiple Intelligences (MI) profile. Built on the metaphor of a restaurant menu, it categorizes opportunities into Appetizers, Main Courses, and Desserts to reflect different levels of energy investment, time commitment, and identity alignment. 

• Appetizers are low-commitment, high-experimentation options. These include part-time jobs, freelance gigs, volunteer roles, side hustles, or any activity that allows a person to test an interest without long-term risk. 

• Main Courses represent a person’s core career or full-time life path. These are the roles that demand the most energy and ideally align with their strongest, most easily expressed traits. A good Main Course is nourishing, sustainable, and built for long-term momentum. 

• Desserts are low-pressure, nourishing extras — hobbies, creative projects, rituals, or personal curiosities that bring joy and express underused traits. Desserts don’t need to be monetized or productive. They exist to feed the Tigers that may not get expression elsewhere. 

The Menu of Life helps people distribute their energy wisely, recognize that not all traits need to be expressed in the same way, and remove the pressure of “finding one perfect job.” It invites users to craft a life composed of multiple elements — a mix of nourishment, experimentation, and joy. 


This tool is especially effective post-assessment (e.g. after the MNTEST), where a person can see which traits are strongest, which are suppressed, and which might benefit from expression through different life categories. It is used in career counseling, coaching, self-alignment processes, and life design strategy.",tool,,"multiple_natures_framework,alignment,trait_expression,facet_role,trait_suppression",

Emotional Intelligence,emotional_intelligence,"A broad capacity that involves recognizing, understanding, regulating, and effectively using emotions — both one’s own and others’ — in a way that promotes awareness, empathy, and relational or behavioral coherence. The term was popularized by Daniel Goleman, who expanded on earlier research by psychologists such as Mayer and Salovey. In Goleman’s framework, emotional intelligence (EI or EQ) consists of five core components: self-awareness, self-regulation, motivation, empathy, and social skills. These elements work together to help individuals navigate complexity, build trust, resolve conflict, and maintain internal balance. High emotional intelligence does not mean emotional suppression or being “nice” — it involves the nuanced, adaptive use of emotion as a source of data and connection. Within an alignment-based system, EI is a critical factor in regulation, connection, and adaptive awareness. It supports flow, trait access, and misalignment repair — especially in social or emotionally charged contexts. Emotional intelligence can be cultivated through intentional practice and feedback, and it is often a stronger predictor of leadership, collaboration, and well-being than cognitive intelligence alone.",concept,"Emotional Fluency,Empathy,Self-Awareness,Self-Regulation,Social Skills,EQ,Interpersonal Intelligence","alignment_intelligence,interpersonal_intelligence,healing_nature,regulation,misalignment,connection_mode",
