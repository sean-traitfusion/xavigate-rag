A good Main Course is nourishing, sustainable, and built for long-term momentum. \n\n\u2022 Desserts are low-pressure, nourishing extras \u2014 hobbies, creative projects, rituals, or personal curiosities that bring joy and express underused traits. Desserts don\u2019t need to be monetized or productive.

The term was popularized by Daniel Goleman, who expanded on earlier research by psychologists such as Mayer and Salovey. In Goleman\u2019s framework, emotional intelligence (EI or EQ) consists of five core components: self-awareness, self-regulation, motivation, empathy, and social skills. These elements work together to help individuals navigate complexity, build trust, resolve conflict, and maintain internal balance. High emotional intelligence does not mean emotional suppression or being \u201cnice\u201d \u2014 it involves the nuanced, adaptive use of emotion as a source of data and connection. Within an alignment-based system, EI is a critical factor in regulation, connection, and adaptive awareness. It supports flow, trait access, and misalignment repair \u2014 especially in social or emotionally charged contexts.
